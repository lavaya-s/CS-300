# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem I was trying to solve was to sort out and store data for courses in a data structure. It needed to be searcheable and functional.
# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The data structure determined how the code was built in order to search through it, how the program ran and its runtime altogether. 
# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Quiote a lot of roadblocks. I ended up changing half of my project before finishing. There was a lot to worjk through to get the searching correct. 
# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I like to understand how the machine does what it does and it helps a lot to see everything as a template for how the rest of the code interacts with it. I also draw a lot more than I was expecting. 
# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I write in a way that makes it so the code follows a pattern. The algorithm can be traced out from little blocks.
